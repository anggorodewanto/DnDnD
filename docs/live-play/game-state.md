# Game State — save file (durable IDs + DM intent)

> **This file holds only what the DB can't derive:** durable IDs, the ops snapshot,
> the current *scene* framing, and the **Next action** (DM intent). It deliberately
> does **NOT** track round / turn / HP / AC / positions / conditions / slots / the
> queue — those are *generated* and served live, aggregated, by the **DM Console**
> (`GET /api/dm/situation` / the `#dm-console` tab). Hand-copying mechanical state
> here is what drifts (it bit this folder repeatedly — see [`sessions/`](sessions/)),
> so we stopped. **Pull live state from the Console; record only intent + IDs + scene
> here.** Per-PC durable kit is in [`party/`](party/); play-by-play in
> [`sessions/`](sessions/). See [`dm-rules.md`](dm-rules.md) "Keep the record straight."

_Last updated: 2026-06-28 — **"The Cellar" is WON and CLOSED.** Both ghouls dead; combat **ended** at R11; the party is **out of combat**. **Forge stabilized** on his own death save (reached **✓3 successes**) — now **0/32, unconscious + prone** (alive, needs tending). **Vale 7/24.** Combat-end has **no HP write-back** (two HP stores), so both PCs' out-of-combat HP/conditions were **set by hand** via the Party status editor. **No active encounter.**
Out of combat there is no live board to pull — the durable post-combat state is in "Current scene"; non-derivable intent is under "Next action."_

## Live mechanical state → DM Console (do not hand-copy here)

Round, turn order, every combatant's HP/AC/position/conditions, the pending queue, and the
recent action timeline are **generated** — read them live, never transcribe them into this file:

- **DM Console:** `GET /api/dm/situation` or the `#dm-console` dashboard tab (`next_step`,
  `pending[]`, `state`, `timeline[]`).
- Source tables (read-only sanity checks): `encounters`, `combatants`, `turns`, `action_log`,
  `dm_queue_items`.

## Ops snapshot

- **Stack:** UP via `make local-up` (docker compose). App `localhost:8080`, DB
  `localhost:5432`. Bot `DnDnD` (id `1507904367301496862`) connected to guild
  `DnDnD`.
- **Last deploy:** `main` (see `git log`); combat state has survived every redeploy.
  Rebuild + redeploy after any code fix: `docker compose up -d --build app`
  (see [`runbook.md`](runbook.md) §1). Redeploy *history* lives in the session logs.
- **Remote-player tunnel:** an **ngrok tunnel on a reserved domain** exposes the
  local app so remote players reach the builder + OAuth. **URL is STABLE**
  (`https://unhustling-cushionless-karan.ngrok-free.dev`), so the OAuth callback
  is registered in Discord **once** and never changes. How-to + `make tunnel-*`
  targets: [`runbook.md`](runbook.md) "Remote players"; one-time setup +
  `NGROK_DOMAIN`/`NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` in `.env`: header of
  [`scripts/tunnel.sh`](../../scripts/tunnel.sh).
  - **OAuth callback (registered, stable):**
    `https://unhustling-cushionless-karan.ngrok-free.dev/portal/auth/callback`.
    No per-restart Discord change. `make tunnel-up` always yields this URL;
    `make tunnel-down` restores `.env` to `localhost` while keeping the ngrok vars.
  - Migrated off the old cloudflared quick tunnel (2026-06-27) — that URL was
    ephemeral and forced a Discord re-register on every restart.

## Active encounter (durable refs — live state via the Console)

- **CLOSED — "The Cellar"** (internal "Cellar — the brood"), encounter id
  `8509d1f6-da9d-451c-bb2e-8571b9402e9e`, map *Ashfall Waystation — cellar*. 4 combatants
  (Vale + Forge vs two ghouls). **Ended in victory 2026-06-28 at R11** — both ghouls dead, Forge
  stabilized. Combat ended; **no active encounter**. Post-combat PC state was carried out by hand
  (no combat-end HP write-back) — see "Current scene". Chronology: [`sessions/session-01.md`](sessions/session-01.md).
- Prior fight — "Waystation — the cellar wretch" (id `6f317490-c43e-44a0-a1d0-b6ed51e58a3e`) —
  ended 2026-06-26 in victory. Full chronology: [`sessions/session-01.md`](sessions/session-01.md).

## Current scene (narrative framing — non-derivable)

**The cellar fight is over and won — the party is out of combat, catching its breath over a downed-but-living Forge.**
Forge cleaved the lead ghoul apart in R4; he and Vale ground down the smaller flank ghoul across R5–R8,
but in R6 it tore out Forge's throat and **he fell** (0 HP, unconscious + prone, into death saves). In
**R8 Vale finished the last ghoul** with a thrown dagger. Vale then rushed to Forge and tried first aid
(**Medicine 6 vs DC 10 — failed**), but Forge held on by his own toughness — his death saves climbed to
**✓3 and he stabilized** (still unconscious at 0 HP, not dying). With no hostiles left, **combat was
ended** (R11). Out of combat now: **Forge 0/32, unconscious + prone (stabilized, needs tending); Vale
7/24** — both set by hand in the Party status editor, since combat-end does **not** write HP back to the
sheets. The brood lie dead; the deeper cellar past the party's light is **unexplored**. Cramped stone,
lit by whatever they carried down. World / lore: [`world.md`](world.md).

## Next action (DM intent — the one thing the Console can't infer)

> Open the **DM Console** first for `next_step` + the live board, then apply this intent.

1. **Fight WON and CLOSED — party is out of combat (post-fight lull, player-driven).** No active
   encounter, no initiative, no hostiles. Both ghouls dead; **Forge stabilized on his own death save
   (✓3 — no longer dying)** after Vale's first-aid attempt failed (**Medicine 6 vs DC 10**); combat was
   **ended** (R11). Reconciled post-combat state (set by hand): **Forge 0/32, unconscious + prone,
   stabilized; Vale 7/24.** A transition beat is posted to #the-story handing the choice back to the
   players — **tend/heal Forge, take a short rest, or press deeper into the cellar.** Let them decide.
   - **If they heal Forge** (potion / spell): apply via **Party → Edit status** — set HP above 0 and
     **uncheck `unconscious`** (a stabilized creature at >0 HP wakes; leave `prone` until he stands).
     If they only rest, a stabilized PC regains 1 HP after 1d4 hours (and wakes); else he stays
     unconscious-but-stable until healed. Vale can be topped up on a rest via the same editor.
   - **Combat-end carry-out is a manual footgun:** ending combat does **not** write combat HP back to the
     sheets — out of combat the Party page shows the *undamaged* stored HP. Both PCs were corrected by
     hand this time (audit reasons logged). **Reconcile every PC's HP/conditions after every End Combat**
     before narrating on. Filed for a fresh agent as **ISSUE-038** (auto-carry-out on End Combat).
   - **If a new fight starts** (deeper cellar, etc.): prep + run the encounter through the combat tools as
     before; keep enemy HP/AC secret ([`dm-rules.md`](dm-rules.md)); players roll their own dice.
   - **Drop-to-0 logging gap (follow-up, non-blocking):** the feature shipped earlier today (`dfefd8e`)
     did **not** log G1's defeat — the player `/attack` damage path doesn't funnel through
     `Service.ApplyDamage` where `notifyDroppedToZero` is gated. Forward-fix candidate; logged in the
     session log + issues, table not blocked.
2. **Onboard new players** as they arrive (`/register` → build → DM-approve → roster row + sheet →
   fold into the fiction). 3-4 more PCs expected. See [`runbook.md`](runbook.md) "Onboarding
   players" + [`big-party.md`](big-party.md).
3. **After every beat:** narrate to #the-story (read-aloud) + append the narrative
   [`sessions/`](sessions/) log. Do **not** transcribe HP/positions back into this file.
