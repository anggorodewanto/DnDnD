# Issues Log — live play

Bugs, rough edges, and surprises found while running real games through the app.
One entry per issue. This is a **DM-side field journal**, distinct from the
AI-playtest harness's formal bug ledger — log freely here; promoting an issue to a
fixed + regression-tested item is a separate decision.

Status: `OPEN` · `WORKAROUND` · `FIXED` · `WONTFIX` · `INFO` (not a bug, just a note).

| # | Date | Area | Severity | Status | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ISSUE-001 | 2026-06-24 | builder / spellcasting | major | FIXED | L3 warlock builder offers only cantrips — no leveled "spells known" selectable (Pact Magic ignored in max-spell-level derivation). |
| ISSUE-002 | 2026-06-24 | builder / persistence | major | FIXED | Full/half-caster `spell_slots` dropped at creation — `CreateCharacterRecord` never set it → portal-built wizard/cleric/etc. **could not cast leveled spells**. Fixed: persist standard slots in the canonical string-keyed `{current,max}` shape the `/cast` reader expects. |
| ISSUE-003 | 2026-06-24 | builder / spellcasting (frontend) | major | FIXED | Eldritch Knight (Fighter) & Arcane Trickster (Rogue) not recognized as casters by the frontend → **Spells step skipped entirely**. Fixed: subclass-aware `isSpellcaster`/budgets in JS + Go (INT third-casters from L3, EK/AT cantrip + spells-known + leveled tables); Spells step now shows with correct caps; server validation accepts the selections. |
| ISSUE-004 | 2026-06-24 | builder / AC | major | FIXED | Unarmored Defense never wired: builder never set `ac_formula`, so Barbarian (10+DEX+CON) & Monk (10+DEX+WIS) got **AC = 10+DEX**. Fixed: `unarmoredDefenseFormula` derives `"10 + DEX + CON"`/`"10 + DEX + WIS"` (the form `CalculateAC`/combat `RecalculateAC` parse, not the seed label) for unarmored barb/monk; fed into `DeriveStats` AC + persisted as `ac_formula`. Monk's UD voids shield bonus; armored falls back to armor AC. |
| ISSUE-005 | 2026-06-24 | builder / proficiency | minor→major | FIXED | Expertise (Rogue/Bard) never wired: combat reads an `"expertise"` proficiency key but the builder never collects it and `character.Proficiencies` has no Expertise field → wrong skill modifiers in play. **Fixed (TDD, `main` 6806bde):** added `Expertise []string` + `JackOfAllTrades` to `character.Proficiencies` (the JSONB `expertise` key `standard_actions.go:567` parses; `SkillModifier` `modifiers.go:25` doubles when a skill is in both expertise+proficient sets); builder collects N expert skills from proficient skills (Rogue L1=2, Bard L3=2) and persists them via `CreateCharacterRecord`; dashboard sheet + a latent levelup round-trip drop also closed. No schema change. Svelte bundle rebuilt. 452 vitest + cover-check green. (Out of scope: thieves'-tools expertise, ddbimport.) |
| ISSUE-006 | 2026-06-24 | builder / spellcasting | minor | FIXED | Level-1 Paladin/Ranger get a phantom L1 spell slot — `CalculateSpellSlots` half path uses `(level+1)/2` → 1 at L1 (half-casters get nothing until L2). Masked in the builder UI by an independent leveled-cap of 0, but wrong `spell_slots`/`max_spell_level` is stored and consumed elsewhere. **Fixed (TDD, `main` 558b2d4):** half-caster branch early-returns `nil` below level 2 (L1 Paladin/Ranger → no slots, max spell level 0); L2+ unchanged (L2 2×L1, L3 3×L1, L5 4×L1+2×L2). Downstream derive_stats / levelup verified. cover-check green. |
| ISSUE-007 | 2026-06-24 | builder / spellcasting (frontend+server) | major | FIXED | Multiclass **is** exposed (up to 4 class rows) and the spell *count* budget used the **primary class only** — frontend (`classEntries[0]`) and server (`primaryClassEntry`) — so secondary caster levels were ignored (budget too low) and a **non-caster primary hid the Spells step entirely** (e.g. Fighter 1 / Wizard 3). **Fixed (TDD, both sides, `main`):** `anyCaster` / `multiclassCantripCap` / `multiclassLeveledCap` (`spellcasting.js`) + `multiclassSpellBudget` (`spellbudget.go`) sum each class's own budget over **every** caster entry (5e computes known/prepared/cantrip counts per class; only spell *slots* combine); `CharacterBuilder.svelte` gate + caps now aggregate across `classEntries`. `max_spell_level` was already multiclass-correct (`DeriveStats` passes all classes) and was left untouched. 473 vitest + `make cover-check` green (overall 90.67%, portal 89.23%). Bundle rebuilt. |
| ISSUE-008 | 2026-06-24 | builder / persistence | blocker | FIXED (adapter) | Portal submit 500s — `characters.languages` is `TEXT[] NOT NULL`, builder sends no languages, `pq.Array(nil)` → SQL NULL → constraint violation. Blocked **all** portal builds. Coerced nil→`[]` in `CreateCharacterRecord`. Underlying collection gap tracked as ISSUE-009. |
| ISSUE-009 | 2026-06-24 | builder / language selection | minor | FIXED | Builder collected **no concrete languages** — `backgrounds.js` carried only a *count* of bonus languages, never the strings, so characters persisted with an empty language list. **Fixed (TDD, `main`, frontend-only):** new `portal/svelte/src/lib/languages.js` (standard+exotic master list; `raceBaseLanguages`/`availableLanguageChoices`/`assembleLanguages`/`bonusLanguageCount`); a Languages block in the Skills step shows the race's base languages (locked, from the `/api/races` `languages` already exposed) + exactly *background-bonus-count* picker slots; `gatherSubmission` ships `languages: assembleLanguages(raceBase, chosen)`; draft persistence wired (`builder-draft.js` allow-list + hydrate/snapshot) and a prune `$effect` keeps picks legal. No Go change (persistence path already wired). 494 vitest green; bundle rebuilt. |
| ISSUE-010 | 2026-06-24 | levelup / persistence | major | FIXED | Level-up persisted `spell_slots` as `map[int]int` → `{"1":4}` (`levelup/levelup.go:14`), but the cast reader `ParseSpellSlots` (`combat/divine_smite.go:71`) unmarshals into `map[string]SlotInfo` (`{current,max}`) → `{"1":4}` failed to unmarshal → `/cast` errored after any level-up. **Fixed (TDD, `main`):** `LevelUpResult.NewSpellSlots` is now `map[string]character.SlotInfo`; new `canonicalSpellSlots` helper converts the `CalculateSpellSlots` result to the string-keyed `{current,max}` shape (full on level-up; `nil` for non-casters so the `!= nil` guard skips the column). Regression test round-trips the emitted JSON through `combat.ParseSpellSlots`. cover-check green (overall 90.68%, levelup 90.45%). Slots emitted full (current==max) on level-up — matches the portal convention + long-rest assumption; prior `current` not preserved (the old shape was unparseable, so this is strictly an improvement). |
| ISSUE-011 | 2026-06-25 | builder / equipment (frontend) | major | FIXED | Portal-built characters persist with **nothing equipped** — `equipped_main_hand`/`off_hand`/`armor` empty, all inventory items `equipped:false` — even when the player equips a weapon/armor in the builder. Breaks `/attack` (no weapon), armor AC, and the card "Equipped" row. Go ingest + adapter persist `EquippedWeapon`/`WornArmor` fine; the drop is **frontend**. **Fixed (TDD, `main` 06a0ac5):** real cause was **async-load ordering** — `CharacterBuilder.svelte`'s reset `$effect`s cleared a valid `wornArmor`/`equippedWeapon` pick while the catalog (`allEquipment`) was still `[]` (e.g. right after a draft restore), because the option lists decided armor/weapon purely from the async catalog `category`. New `portal/svelte/src/lib/equip-selection.js` (`reconcileEquipPick` + category-OR-SRD-id fallback mirroring the Go `knownWeapons`/`knownArmor` maps) clears only on a genuine non-option, never on a transient catalog miss. Also wired `EquippedOffHand` (shield via `hasEquipmentItem(equipment,"shield")`). 461 vitest, bundle rebuilt, cover-check green. Workaround pre-deploy: player runs `/equip` in Discord. |
| ISSUE-012 | 2026-06-25 | character card / spellcasting | minor | FIXED | Discord character card + `/character` embed show **"Spell Slots: —" for warlocks** — they read only the `spell_slots` column and never fall back to `pact_magic_slots`. **Fixed (TDD, `main` 5090e02):** both surfaces now pact-aware — parse the canonical `character.PactMagicSlots` ({slot_level,current,max}) and render `Pact Magic: N × Lvl L`; a multiclass caster shows standard + pact joined by ` | `; non-casters keep `—`. `charactercard/format.go`+`service.go` (`CardData.PactMagicSlots`, `formatPactMagicSlots`, `parsePactMagicSlots`), `discord/character_handler.go` (`buildSpellSlotSummary` + a Spell Slots line in `buildCharacterEmbed`). cover-check green. |
| ISSUE-013 | 2026-06-25 | builder / submit (server) | blocker | FIXED | Friend's **barbarian / guild-artisan** submit 400s: `skill "insight" is not selectable for this class`. Root cause = **slug drift** between two hand-maintained Go background maps and the builder's kebab-case slugs. `backgroundSkillProficiencies` (`derive_stats.go`) had **no `guild-artisan`** case and keyed folk-hero as `"folk hero"` (space); both backgrounds therefore resolved to ∅ locked skills, so their PHB grants (insight+persuasion) were treated as off-list class picks and rejected. `backgroundStartingEquipment` (`starting_equipment.go`) had the same space-slug bug → those two backgrounds also silently got no starting-equipment pack. **Fixed (TDD, `main`):** both Go maps re-keyed to the exact 13 builder slugs (kebab-case) + `guild-artisan` added; two contract tests (`TestBackgroundSkillProficiencies_AllBuilderBackgrounds`, `TestBackgroundEquipmentPack_AllBuilderBackgrounds`) lock every builder slug so future drift fails CI; removed a stale test that asserted the old Title-Case `"Folk Hero"` input (never sent by the real builder — why the bug hid). cover-check green. **Deeper fix (SSOT) tracked separately.** |
| ISSUE-014 | 2026-06-25 | dm console / action log | medium | FIXED + DEPLOYED | DM Console didn't track player combat actions — spell casts + freeform actions post to #combat-log but were never written to `action_log`, so `GET /api/dm/situation` `timeline[]` showed nothing for them. **Fixed (`main` f1e3aeb, pushed, redeployed ~13:45 UTC):** a best-effort `recordCombatAction` helper (new `internal/combat/action_log_record.go`) now writes an `action_log` row at the success tail of every player combat path (`Cast`, `CastAoE`, `FreeformAction`, `Attack`, `attackImprovised`, `OffhandAttack`). **DM-side only** — player-facing #combat-log output is unchanged; the Console is behind DM auth. Save adjudication stays a manual DM roll (no auto #dm-queue item, no auto NPC save). |
| ISSUE-015 | 2026-06-26 | combat / ammunition | major | FIXED | Crossbow `/attack` falsely reports **"No bolts remaining"** with bolts in inventory — ammo match required name `"Bolts"` + type `"ammunition"`, but the builder seeds `{item_id:"crossbow-bolt", type:"gear"}` (slug drift, cf. ISSUE-013). **Fixed (TDD):** tolerant whole-word matcher on name/`item_id` (bolts/arrows), lossless full-inventory write (the old narrow re-marshal would have dropped every item's equipped/magic/charges fields once the shot succeeded), and a real empty quiver now routes to `#dm-queue` as a freeform action for lenient DM adjudication (attack resource not spent). Needs rebuild+restart to apply live. |
| ISSUE-015 | 2026-06-25 | dashboard / conditions | high | FIXED | Condition-shape mismatch between the dashboard and the engine, in two halves. **DISPLAY half FIXED** (`b108bf2`): the Combat Manager rendered a condition object as "[object Object]" because the engine stores conditions as objects (`{condition:"paralyzed",…}`) but the Svelte UI interpolated each entry as a string — new `conditionName()` helper now Title-Cases either an object's `.condition` or a bare string. **WRITE half FIXED (2026-06-26):** the workspace PATCH `/api/combat/{id}/combatants/{cid}/conditions` used to persist a bare string array (`["paralyzed"]`) that `parseConditions` can't unmarshal, so a button-added condition rendered but its mechanical effects (auto-crit, advantage-to-attackers, auto-fail STR/DEX saves) never fired. New server-side `reconcileConditionNames` (`workspace_handler.go`) maps the DM-supplied condition *names* into the canonical `[]CombatCondition` object shape — reusing the combatant's existing condition object when the name is already present (so a spell-applied duration/source/timing survives a re-send) and minting an indefinite `{condition: name}` for new ones, lowercased + de-duped. Frontend now works in lowercase canonical keys (`conditionKey` helper). |
| ISSUE-016 | 2026-06-25 | combat / spellcasting | medium | FIXED + DEPLOYED | `/done` falsely warned "you still have 1 attack" after a player cast a spell with their ACTION. Casting a spell is the Cast-a-Spell action, not the Attack action, so no weapon attack remains — but `Service.Cast`/`Service.CastAoE` consumed the action while leaving the seeded `attacks_remaining=1`, so the `/done` unused-resource check (and the "Remaining" summary) reported a phantom attack. **Fixed (`b108bf2`):** zero `turn.AttacksRemaining` when a spell consumes the action (cantrip or leveled); bonus-action casts left untouched (they keep the Attack action + its attacks). Found in live play: Vale (Warlock 3, no Extra Attack) cast Hold Person, then `/done` warned of an attack she never had. |
| ISSUE-017 | 2026-06-26 | refdata / item catalog (SSOT) | major (tech-debt) | OPEN — SCOPED | **Permanent SSOT fix** for the recurring slug/type/quantity drift class (ISSUE-013 background slugs, ISSUE-015 ammo, the builder-ammo follow-up). Item metadata is fragmented across **5 hand-maintained sources** and **ammo + adventuring gear have no refdata row at all**. Scope a single canonical seeded **item catalog** (`id → {name, type, default_quantity, weapon/armor/ammo metadata, weapon→ammo FK}`); route the builder inventory seeder, combat ammo derivation, the ammo matcher, and `/api/equipment` through it; codegen the JS-side table from the same Go source (as backgrounds already do). Full plan + file pointers in Details. **For a fresh agent.** |

## Details

### ISSUE-001 — Warlock builder shows only cantrips (Pact Magic not derived)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Area:** portal character builder / spellcasting
- **Severity:** major — a warlock built via the web builder cannot pick any leveled
  spell, only cantrips. Renders the class' core mechanic unusable from the UI.
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Repro:** Build a single-class warlock (level ≥ 1, observed at level 3) in
  `/portal/create`. On the Spells step, cantrips (level 0) are selectable but all
  level 1–2 spells are unselectable/greyed.
- **Expected:** A level-3 warlock selects 2 cantrips **and** 4 known spells of
  level ≤ 2 (Pact Magic slot level at L3 = 2).
- **Actual:** Only cantrips selectable.
- **Root cause (verified):** Pact Magic is not folded into the builder's max
  spell level.
  - `character.CalculateSpellSlots` returns `nil` for a single-class warlock:
    the "half" branch is skipped (warlock is `"pact"`), then
    `CalculateCasterLevel` maps `"pact"` → 0 (`internal/character/spellslots.go:68`,
    `:129-145`).
  - The builder derives `MaxSpellLevel` solely from those (nil) slots →
    stays `0` (`internal/portal/derive_stats.go:97-103`).
  - Frontend: `levelsUpTo(0)` → `[]`, so `SpellPicker.isLevelSelectable` rejects
    every leveled spell while cantrips pass unconditionally
    (`portal/svelte/src/lib/spellcasting.js`, `.../spell-picker.js`).
  - `character.PactMagicSlotsForLevel` (`spellslots.go:112-124`) computes the
    correct pact slot level but is **never called** on this path.
- **Not a data bug:** warlock leveled spells are seeded — `SELECT level, count(*)
  FROM spells WHERE 'warlock' = ANY(classes) GROUP BY level;` → 9 at L1, 12 at L2,
  14 at L3, …
- **Fix idea:** Fold pact slot level into `MaxSpellLevel` for pact casters in
  `derive_stats.go` (consult `PactMagicSlotsForLevel`). Also verify the final
  character-create path actually persists `pact_magic_slots` so the built warlock
  can cast in play (separate from the UI gate). TDD + `make cover-check`.
- **Workaround:** finish the build cantrips-only and inject known spells +
  `pact_magic_slots` directly in the DB, or just fix it.
- **FIX (2026-06-24, TDD, on `main` working tree — not yet committed):** wired
  Pact Magic into the builder.
  - `internal/portal/derive_stats.go`: added `PactMagicSlots` to `DerivedStats` +
    a `pactMagicSlotsForClasses` helper; `DeriveStats` now raises `MaxSpellLevel`
    to the pact slot level (via `character.PactMagicSlotsForLevel`) for pact
    casters, combining with standard slots via max for multiclass.
  - `internal/portal/builder_store_adapter.go`: `CreateCharacterRecord` now
    persists `pact_magic_slots` for pact casters (non-warlocks unaffected).
  - Tests: 6 new red→green cases in `derive_stats_test.go` +
    `builder_store_adapter_test.go` (L3 warlock → MaxSpellLevel 2 + slots
    `{2,2,2}`; warlock/wizard multiclass → 3; non-casters nil; persistence).
  - `make cover-check` green (overall 90.63%, portal 88.61%). App rebuilt +
    restarted so the fix is live.

### ISSUE-002 — Standard-caster spell_slots may not persist at creation (UNCONFIRMED)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Area:** portal character builder / persistence
- **Severity:** unknown (potentially major if portal-built casters can't cast)
- **Status:** OPEN — **unconfirmed**, surfaced while fixing ISSUE-001.
- **Observation:** `BuilderStoreAdapter.CreateCharacterRecord`
  (`internal/portal/builder_store_adapter.go`) sets `PactMagicSlots` (after the
  ISSUE-001 fix) but never sets the generated `refdata.CreateCharacterParams.
  SpellSlots`, even though `DeriveStats` computes `SpellSlots` for full/half
  casters. Read paths appear to read the stored `spell_slots` column
  (`cmd/dndnd/dashboard_apis.go:324`).
- **To confirm:** build a wizard/cleric via the portal, approve, and check
  whether `/cast` / the sheet shows spell slots. If empty → real bug; fix by
  persisting `DeriveStats.SpellSlots` in the adapter (mirroring the pact fix). If
  slots appear → they're derived on read somewhere; close as INFO.

### ISSUE-004 — Unarmored Defense AC never wired (Barbarian/Monk) (FIXED)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Area:** portal character builder / AC derivation + persistence
- **Severity:** major — unarmored Barbarian/Monk got AC = 10 + DEX (missing
  CON/WIS), wrong at creation and at every combat AC recompute.
- **Status:** FIXED (TDD, `main`).
- **Root cause:** `DeriveStats` called `CalculateAC(..., "")` with an empty
  formula and `CreateCharacterRecord` never set `ac_formula`; combat
  `RecalculateAC` (`internal/combat/equip.go:387-419`) reads only `char.AcFormula`
  for unarmored defense. Only the Discord REST + DDB paths wrote it before.
- **Contract correction:** the live `ac_formula` value is the token form
  **`"10 + DEX + CON"` / `"10 + DEX + WIS"`** parsed by `evaluateACFormula`
  (`internal/character/stats.go:98`, mirrored in `equip.go:450`) — NOT the seed
  `mechanical_effect` label `ac_10_plus_dex_plus_con` (that label only drives
  feature definitions). A shield adds +2 unless the formula contains `WIS`
  (Monk UD voids it) — identical guard in `stats.go:70` and `equip.go:417`.
- **Fix:** `unarmoredDefenseFormula(classEntries, wornArmor, hasShield)` in
  `derive_stats.go` returns the CON form for an unarmored barbarian (shield ok),
  the WIS form for an unarmored, shieldless monk, else `""` (multiclass barb+monk
  prefers barbarian). `DeriveStats` feeds it to `CalculateAC`; `CreateCharacterRecord`
  persists it as `sql.NullString` (NULL for armored/non-UD). Tests in
  `derive_stats_test.go` + `builder_store_adapter_test.go` (barb 15, monk 15,
  barb+shield 17, armored barb → armor AC, fighter unchanged; persistence cases).
  `make cover-check` green (portal 89.30%). `DeriveAC` left untouched (no live
  callers).

### ISSUE-003 — EK/AT not recognized as casters in the builder (FIXED)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Area:** portal character builder (frontend gate + Go validation)
- **Severity:** major — an Eldritch Knight (Fighter) or Arcane Trickster (Rogue)
  built via the web builder got **no spell picker** (Spells step skipped). Worse
  than the warlock bug (warlock at least showed cantrips).
- **Status:** FIXED (TDD, `main`).
- **Root cause:** `CASTER_ABILITY` / `isSpellcaster` (`portal/svelte/src/lib/
  spellcasting.js`) keyed only on base class → `isCaster` false for fighter/rogue
  → `builder-steps.js` hid/skipped the Spells step. The Go spell-budget
  (`internal/portal/spellbudget.go`, used by `validateSpellCount`) likewise
  returned 0 for fighter/rogue, so even a shown picker would have been rejected on
  submit. Server `max_spell_level` (via `isThirdCasterSubclass` →
  `CalculateCasterLevel`) was already correct and untouched.
- **Fix:** made both sides subclass-aware. JS: `isThirdCaster(subclass, level)`
  (EK/AT slugs, level ≥ 3 = INT caster), `isSpellcaster`/
  `spellcastingAbilityForClass`/`cantripsKnown`/`leveledSpellCap` fall through to
  third-caster tables (EK 2→3 cantrips, AT 3→4, shared spells-known table);
  threaded subclass + level into `CharacterBuilder.svelte`. Go: mirrored
  `isThirdCaster` + third-caster tables in `spellbudget.go`; `spellCountCap`
  (`builder_service.go`) no longer bails for `SlotProgression=="none"` when EK/AT.
  Tests: Go `spellbudget_test.go` (EK/AT budgets + `validateSpellCount`), JS
  `spellcasting.test.js` (EK/AT casters, plain fighter/EK-L2 not). `npm test`
  441/441, `make cover-check` green (portal 89.12%). **Svelte bundle rebuilt**
  (`vite build`) since `internal/portal/assets/` is git-tracked.

### ISSUE-002 — Full/half-caster spell_slots dropped at creation (FIXED)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Area:** portal character builder / persistence
- **Severity:** major — portal-built wizard/cleric/sorcerer/druid/bard/paladin/
  ranger stored with `spell_slots = NULL`; `/cast` rejected them (no slots).
- **Status:** FIXED (TDD, `main`).
- **Root cause:** `DeriveStats` computes `SpellSlots` but the adapter
  `CreateCharacterRecord` (`internal/portal/builder_store_adapter.go`) only
  persisted `pact_magic_slots`, never standard `SpellSlots` → SQL NULL. Read paths
  (`/cast` → `parseIntKeyedSlots` → `ParseSpellSlots`) trust the stored column.
- **Fix:** added `spellSlotsForClasses` (`internal/portal/derive_stats.go`) that
  reuses `character.CalculateSpellSlots` and emits the canonical **string-keyed
  `{current,max}`** shape (fresh caster starts full, `current==max`); set
  `SpellSlots` in `CreateCharacterRecord` (NULL for non-casters). 3 red→green
  tests (Wizard L3, Paladin L2, Fighter L3 non-caster). `make cover-check` green
  (portal 89.05%, overall 90.66%). Verified the shape matches `ParseSpellSlots`
  (`combat/divine_smite.go:71`) + the dashboard `map[string]character.SlotInfo`
  reader, not level-up's incompatible `map[int]int` (→ ISSUE-010).

### ISSUE-008 — Portal submit 500s: languages NOT NULL violated (FIXED at write; collection gap OPEN)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Area:** portal character builder / persistence
- **Severity:** blocker — every portal "submit for DM approval" failed with HTTP 500.
- **Status:** FIXED (write-side) · underlying language-collection gap OPEN.
- **Repro:** Build any character in `/portal/create`, submit. Bot/app log:
  `ERROR creating character error="creating character: ERROR: null value in
  column "languages" of relation "characters" violates not-null constraint
  (SQLSTATE 23502)"`.
- **Root cause:** `db/migrations/20260310120006_create_characters.sql:28` →
  `languages TEXT[] NOT NULL`. Chain: submission `Languages []string`
  (`builder_service.go:48`, json `omitempty`) → `CreateCharacterParams.Languages`
  (`builder_service.go:510`) → adapter `Languages: p.Languages`
  (`builder_store_adapter.go:178`) → `pq.Array(arg.Languages)`
  (`refdata/characters.sql.go:105`). The Svelte builder **never collects concrete
  language strings** — `backgrounds.js` only carries a *count* of bonus languages
  — so the slice is always nil. `pq.GenericArray.Value()` returns SQL NULL for a
  nil slice → constraint violation. Guaranteed 500 for all portal builds; only
  surfaced now because this is the campaign's first portal-built character.
- **Fix (2026-06-24, TDD, `main` working tree, not committed):** in
  `CreateCharacterRecord` coerce `nil` → `[]string{}` before the insert
  (`pq.Array([]string{})` writes `'{}'`, non-null). 2 red→green tests in
  `builder_store_adapter_test.go` (nil → empty array; provided langs pass
  through). `make cover-check` green (portal 88.70%). App rebuilt + restarted.
- **Follow-up:** the builder collects no concrete languages — tracked separately
  as **ISSUE-009**.

### ISSUE-009 — Builder collects no concrete languages (only a count)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Area:** portal character builder / language selection
- **Severity:** minor — cosmetic today (languages aren't consumed in combat), but
  every portal-built character has an empty language list. Surfaced by ISSUE-008.
- **Status:** OPEN.
- **Detail:** `portal/svelte/src/lib/backgrounds.js` models bonus languages as an
  integer *count* (`languages: 2`, rendered via `formatLanguages`) and the builder
  never turns race base languages or that count into concrete strings.
  `CharacterSubmission.Languages` (`internal/portal/builder_service.go:48`,
  json `omitempty`) is therefore always empty, so `characters.languages` persists
  as `'{}'` (post ISSUE-008 fix; was a 500 before).
- **FIX (2026-06-25, TDD, `main`, frontend-only):** no Go/API change needed — the
  races endpoint already returns each race's base `languages` (Title-Cased, from
  `internal/refdata/seed_races.go` → `RaceInfo.Languages` → `/api/races`), and the
  persistence path already ships `submission.Languages`. New
  `portal/svelte/src/lib/languages.js` holds the standard+exotic master list and
  pure helpers `raceBaseLanguages` / `availableLanguageChoices` (case-insensitive
  exclusion) / `assembleLanguages` (case-insensitive de-dupe, first-seen order) /
  `bonusLanguageCount`. `CharacterBuilder.svelte` gained a Languages block in the
  **Skills step**: the race's base languages render as locked chips, then exactly
  `bonusLanguageCount(background)` `<select>` slots drawn from
  `availableLanguageChoices` let the player pick that many distinct bonus
  languages; `gatherSubmission` sets `languages: assembleLanguages(raceBase,
  chosenLanguages)`. Draft survival wired (`builder-draft.js` `DRAFT_FIELDS`
  allow-list + hydrate/snapshot) and a prune `$effect` drops picks that stop
  being valid when race/background changes. Tests: `languages.test.js` (21 cases).
  494 vitest green; svelte bundle rebuilt. **Remaining gap:** exotic-language
  gating (some are normally DM-granted) and class-bonus languages aren't modeled —
  the picker offers the full list; acceptable for now.

### ISSUE-007 — Multiclass spell count budget used primary class only (FIXED)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24 (fixed 2026-06-25)
- **Area:** portal character builder (frontend gate + budget) + server count cap
- **Severity:** major — confirmed: the builder exposes multiclass (an "add class"
  button, up to 4 class rows, `CharacterBuilder.svelte:882`).
- **Status:** FIXED (TDD, `main`).
- **Root cause:** the spell *count* budget was derived from the primary class
  only on both sides. Frontend: `isCaster` / `cantripCap` / `leveledCap` read
  `classEntries[0]` (`CharacterBuilder.svelte:520-528`). Server:
  `spellCountCap` read `primaryClassEntry` (`builder_service.go`). Two symptoms —
  (a) a multiclass caster (e.g. Wizard 3 / Cleric 1) got a budget too low because
  the secondary's cantrips/known/prepared were never added; (b) worse, a
  non-caster *primary* with a caster *secondary* (Fighter 1 / Wizard 3) made
  `isCaster` false → `builder-steps.js` hid the Spells step entirely.
- **Not the max spell level:** `DeriveStats` already passes **all** classes to
  `character.CalculateSpellSlots` (`derive_stats.go:102`), so `max_spell_level` /
  `spellSelectableLevels` (which spell *levels* are selectable) were already
  multiclass-correct. Left untouched.
- **Fix:** sum each class's own budget across **every** caster entry — 5e computes
  known/prepared/cantrip counts per class (only spell *slots* combine on the
  shared caster-level table). JS: new `anyCaster`, `multiclassCantripCap`,
  `multiclassLeveledCap` (`spellcasting.js`); the component's gate + caps now
  aggregate over `classEntries` and pass a per-ability modifier map so each entry
  uses its own casting ability. Go: new `multiclassSpellBudget`
  (`spellbudget.go`) reusing the exact `SlotProgression=="none" && !isThirdCaster`
  guard; `spellCountCap` delegates to it. Single-class behaviour is the one-term
  sum, unchanged.
- **Tests:** JS `spellcasting.test.js` (`anyCaster`, multiclass cantrip/leveled
  caps incl. non-caster-primary); Go `spellbudget_test.go`
  (`TestMulticlassSpellBudget`, `TestSpellCountCap_Multiclass`,
  `TestValidateSpellCount_Multiclass` — a Fighter1/Wizard3 submission at the
  wizard's budget now passes where the primary-only cap rejected it). 473 vitest +
  `make cover-check` green (overall 90.67%, portal 89.23%). Svelte bundle rebuilt
  (`internal/portal/assets/` is git-tracked).

### ISSUE-010 — Level-up wrote spell_slots in an unparseable shape (FIXED)
- **Date:** 2026-06-24 (fixed 2026-06-25)
- **Area:** level-up persistence vs the `/cast` read path
- **Severity:** major — any leveled caster that leveled up could no longer cast.
- **Status:** FIXED (TDD, `main`).
- **Root cause:** `CalculateLevelUp` built `NewSpellSlots` as `map[int]int`
  (`levelup/levelup.go`) and `service.go` marshaled it raw → `{"1":4,"2":2}`. The
  canonical reader `combat.ParseSpellSlots` (`combat/divine_smite.go:71`)
  unmarshals into `map[string]character.SlotInfo`
  (`{"1":{"current":4,"max":4}}`), so the number-shaped JSON failed with
  `cannot unmarshal number into Go value of type combat.SlotInfo` and `/cast`
  rejected the character.
- **Fix:** changed `LevelUpResult.NewSpellSlots` to
  `map[string]character.SlotInfo`; added `canonicalSpellSlots(map[int]int)` that
  string-keys each slot level and sets `Current == Max == count` (full on
  level-up), returning `nil` for an empty/nil source so `service.go`'s `!= nil`
  guard still skips the column for non-casters. `service.go` unchanged. Confined
  to `internal/levelup`.
- **Tests:** `TestCalculateLevelUp_SpellSlotsParseViaCombat` (RED→GREEN: marshals
  the wizard 2→3 level-up slots and round-trips them through
  `combat.ParseSpellSlots`, asserting `{current,max}` == `MulticastSpellSlots(3)`)
  + `TestCalculateLevelUp_NonCasterSpellSlotsNil`. `make cover-check` green
  (overall 90.68%, levelup 90.45%).
- **Simplification:** slots emitted full (current==max); prior `current` not
  preserved. Acceptable — level-ups conventionally land on a long rest, and the
  old shape was unusable, so any valid shape is a strict improvement.

### ISSUE-014 — DM Console does not track player combat actions (action_log gap)
- **Date:** 2026-06-25
- **Area:** dm console / action log (player-action service vs `/api/dm/situation`)
- **Severity:** medium — DM situational-awareness gap. Combat resolves correctly;
  only the DM Console's after-the-fact timeline was blind to player actions.
- **Status:** FIXED + DEPLOYED (`main` f1e3aeb, pushed `f29edd4..f1e3aeb`,
  redeployed ~13:45 UTC).
- **Detail:** Player spell casts and freeform actions post their results to
  `#combat-log`, but the player-action service paths never wrote to the `action_log`
  table. As a result `GET /api/dm/situation` returned a `timeline[]` with nothing for
  player combat actions — the DM Console looked empty even mid-fight.
- **Root cause:** the player-action service entry points — `Service.Cast`,
  `Service.CastAoE`, `Service.FreeformAction`, `Service.Attack`,
  `Service.OffhandAttack` — never called `CreateActionLog`. Only the DM-side /
  automated flows (enemy turns, legendary actions, the DM dashboard) write to
  `action_log`, so the timeline was populated for those but not for anything a player
  did.
- **FIX (2026-06-25, TDD, `main` f1e3aeb — committed, pushed, deployed):** a
  best-effort `recordCombatAction` helper (new file
  `internal/combat/action_log_record.go`) now writes an `action_log` row at the
  **success tail** of every player combat path — `Service.Cast`, `CastAoE`,
  `FreeformAction`, `Attack`, `attackImprovised`, `OffhandAttack`. That table feeds
  the DM Console `/api/dm/situation` timeline, so player casts/freeform/attacks now
  appear alongside the automated entries. `make cover-check` green (90%/85% gates);
  independent code review = ship-ready. Redeployed via
  `docker compose up -d --build app` ~13:45 UTC — clean boot ("database connected and
  migrated", no new migration; "discord session opened"; all discord checks passed
  for guild `1507910398886543532`; server on `:8080`; no panic/error).
- **Scope note (important):** this is a **DM-SIDE fix only**. Player-facing Discord
  output is **unchanged** — a spell cast already posted the `✨ {caster} casts {spell}`
  line to `#combat-log` and that always worked; the fix only adds the DM Console
  timeline entry, and the Console is behind DM auth (players never see it). The fix
  does **not** auto-create a `#dm-queue` item for save-spells and does **not**
  auto-roll an NPC's saving throw — **save adjudication stays a MANUAL DM roll**.
- **Follow-up (candidate, not yet a numbered issue):** auto-resolving an NPC's
  saving throw (and/or surfacing a `#dm-queue` prompt) for player save-spells is a
  worthwhile future enhancement — today it remains a manual DM roll.

### ISSUE-015 — Condition shape mismatch: dashboard vs the engine (FIXED — both halves)
- **Date:** 2026-06-25 (write half fixed 2026-06-26)
- **Area:** dashboard / combat conditions (Combat Manager render + workspace PATCH +
  Svelte tracker vs engine `parseConditions`)
- **Severity:** high — the WRITE half was a **silent mechanical no-op**: a
  button-added condition showed on the tracker but did nothing in the rules engine.
- **Status:** **FIXED** — DISPLAY half (`b108bf2`, deployed) · WRITE half (2026-06-26).
- **Two halves:**
  - **DISPLAY (the render) — FIXED.** The Combat Manager rendered a combatant's
    condition as **"[object Object]"** because the engine stores conditions as objects
    (`{condition:"paralyzed",...}`) but the Svelte UI interpolated each entry directly
    as a string.
  - **WRITE (the persisted shape) — OPEN.** The workspace PATCH endpoint
    `/api/combat/{id}/combatants/{cid}/conditions` (and the Svelte tracker that drives
    the "add condition" button) still write conditions as a **bare JSON string array**,
    e.g. `["paralyzed"]`. The combat engine reads conditions via `parseConditions`
    as an **array of objects keyed by `.condition`**, e.g.
    `[{"condition":"paralyzed",...}]`.
- **WRITE-half symptom (still live):** a condition added through the normal dashboard
  button now *renders* correctly (post-display-fix), but its mechanical effects —
  auto-crit (melee within 5 ft of a paralyzed target), advantage-to-attackers,
  auto-fail STR/DEX saves — **do NOT fire**, because `.Condition` parses empty out of
  the string-array shape.
- **Only correct WRITE path today:** the DM-Override endpoint POST
  `/api/combat/{id}/override/combatant/{cid}/conditions` is the lone HTTP path that
  writes the correct object shape (which is why the wretch's *hold person* paralysis,
  applied via that override-equivalent path in the object shape, fires correctly — and
  now also renders correctly — while a button-added condition would render but no-op).
- **FIX (DISPLAY half, 2026-06-25, `main` `b108bf2`, pushed `0dfa1ec..b108bf2`,
  deployed ~22:50 UTC):** new `conditionName()` helper
  (`dashboard/svelte/src/lib/combat.js`) Title-Cases either an object's `.condition`
  or a bare string; `CombatManager.svelte` now renders `conditionName(cond)` instead of
  interpolating the raw entry. vitest 64/64, svelte build clean, embedded assets
  regenerated. **Display-only** — the persisted WRITE shape is untouched.
- **FIX (WRITE half, 2026-06-26, TDD, `main` working tree):** aligned the PATCH
  endpoint to the engine object shape, server-side (the canonical-shape boundary), so
  the API and the Svelte tracker stay simple (they speak condition *names*).
  - **Server** (`internal/combat/workspace_handler.go`): new
    `reconcileConditionNames(existing, names)` maps the DM-supplied condition *names*
    (`updateConditionsRequest.Conditions []string`, unchanged) to the canonical
    `[]CombatCondition` object array `parseConditions` reads. It **reconciles** against
    the combatant's existing stored conditions: a name already present keeps its
    existing object (so a spell-/engine-applied condition's `duration_rounds`,
    `started_round`, `source_combatant_id`, `expires_on`, `source_spell` survive a
    re-send of the full set), a new name becomes an indefinite manual condition
    (`{condition: name}`, matching DM-toggle semantics). Names are lowercased to the
    engine's canonical keys, blanks skipped, de-duped first-seen. An unparseable
    existing value (e.g. a legacy bare-string write) is treated as empty, so the next
    PATCH self-heals the row into the object shape. `UpdateCombatantConditions` now
    calls it instead of `json.Marshal(req.Conditions)`.
  - **Frontend** (`dashboard/svelte/src/lib/combat.js` + `CombatManager.svelte`): new
    `conditionKey(c)` returns the engine's lowercase name for a string **or** object
    entry; `currentConditions()` maps stored entries through it, and `handleAddCondition`
    canonicalizes the dropdown value (`conditionKey(conditionToAdd)`), so add/remove/
    dedup compare consistently and the PATCH body is a clean lowercase name array.
  - **Tests (red→green):** Go `workspace_handler_test.go` — `WritesEngineObjectShape`
    (Title-Cased input → object array, lowercase names, `HasCondition` fires),
    `PreservesExistingObjectMetadata` (duration/source/timing survive a re-send),
    `DedupesAndDropsRemoved`, `RecoversFromLegacyStringShape`. JS `combat.test.js` —
    `conditionKey` cases. `make cover-check` green (combat 91.7%); 575 vitest green;
    Svelte bundle rebuilt (`internal/dashboard/assets/` is git-tracked).
  - **Not changed:** the engine's `parseConditions` (kept strict — object shape only)
    and the DM-Override POST path (already correct). Both writers now converge on the
    one canonical shape.

### ISSUE-016 — `/done` phantom "1 attack" warning after casting a spell with the action (FIXED)
- **Date:** 2026-06-25
- **Area:** combat / spellcasting (action economy — `Service.Cast` / `Service.CastAoE`
  vs the `/done` unused-resource check)
- **Severity:** medium — misleading UX; a phantom unused-attack warning could cause a
  player to waste time or a DM to mis-rule the turn.
- **Status:** FIXED + DEPLOYED (`main` `b108bf2`, pushed `0dfa1ec..b108bf2`, redeployed
  ~22:50 UTC).
- **Repro:** A character with **no Extra Attack** (e.g. Warlock 3) casts a spell using
  their **action** (cantrip or leveled), then runs **`/done`**.
- **Expected:** No unused-resource warning for a weapon attack — the action was spent on
  Cast-a-Spell, so there is no Attack action and no weapon attack remaining.
- **Actual:** `/done` warned **"you still have 1 attack"** and the "Remaining" resource
  summary listed a phantom attack.
- **Root cause:** casting a spell is the **Cast-a-Spell action, not the Attack action**,
  so no weapon attack remains — but `Service.Cast` / `Service.CastAoE` consumed the
  action while leaving the seeded `attacks_remaining=1` untouched. The `/done`
  unused-resource check (and the "Remaining" summary) read that stale `attacks_remaining`
  and reported an attack the caster never had.
- **FIX (2026-06-25, TDD, `main` `b108bf2`):** zero `turn.AttacksRemaining` when a spell
  consumes the **action** (cantrip or leveled). **Bonus-action casts are left untouched**
  — those keep the Attack action and its attacks (e.g. a quickened/bonus-action spell
  plus a weapon attack is legal). Red/green test
  `internal/combat/cast_attacks_remaining_test.go`; `make cover-check` passes.
- **Discovered in live play:** Vale (Warlock 3, no Extra Attack) cast **Hold Person**,
  then `/done` warned of an attack she never had.
- **Caveat (live state):** the fix only affects casts made on the **new binary**. Vale's
  *current* in-flight turn still carries the pre-fix `attacks_remaining=1`, so `/done`
  will warn **once more** for this turn — she just confirms past it; her **next** cast is
  clean.

### ISSUE-015 — Crossbow `/attack` falsely reports "No bolts remaining" with a full quiver
- **Date:** 2026-06-26
- **Area:** combat / ammunition
- **Severity:** major
- **Status:** FIXED (TDD; rebuild + redeploy required to take effect live)
- **Repro:** A character whose inventory holds crossbow bolts runs `/attack` with a
  crossbow. The bot rejects the shot with **"No bolts remaining."** despite the bolts
  being present.
- **Expected:** the shot fires and one bolt is deducted.
- **Actual:** every crossbow shot is blocked; the player can never fire.
- **Root cause:** the ammo check matched too strictly. The character builder seeds a
  light crossbow's ammo as `{item_id:"crossbow-bolt", name:"crossbow-bolt", type:"gear"}`,
  but `combat.DeductAmmunition` only matched an item whose **name was exactly "Bolts"**
  **and** whose **type was exactly "ammunition"** — so the seeded slug never matched and
  the deduction reported empty. (Same class of slug-vs-display-name drift as ISSUE-013.)
- **Second bug it would have unmasked:** the ammo write round-tripped the *entire*
  inventory through a narrow 3-field projection (`{name,quantity,type}`), so once the
  match was fixed and the write path was reached it would have **silently dropped every
  other item's `equipped`/magic/charges/`item_id` fields on each shot** (un-equipping
  the player's gear). Fixed at the same time.
- **FIX (2026-06-26, TDD, `internal/combat` + `internal/discord` + `cmd/dndnd`):**
  1. **Tolerant matcher** (`ammoMatches`): a crossbow now matches any non-weapon,
     non-armor, non-consumable item whose name **or** `item_id` contains the whole word
     `bolt` (bows → `arrow`) — so `"crossbow-bolt"`, `"Crossbow Bolts"`, `"Bolts"`,
     `"bolt"` all count, while a `"Lightning Bolt Scroll"` consumable does not. Applied to
     both `DeductAmmunition` and the post-combat `RecoverAmmunition`.
  2. **Lossless write:** the ammo path now parses/marshals through the full
     `character.InventoryItem`, preserving every other item's fields.
  3. **DM-queue fallback:** a genuinely empty quiver now raises a typed
     `combat.NoAmmunitionError`; `/attack` posts a `#dm-queue` **freeform action**
     ("is out of bolts — wants to shoot … anyway (DM may waive ammo)") and tells the
     player the DM was flagged, instead of a dead-end rejection. The attack resource is
     **not** consumed on this path, so the player can re-fire once the DM resolves it.
     DMs commonly hand-wave precise ammo counts — this routes that decision to them.
- **Tests:** `internal/combat/attack_test.go` (seeded-slug deduct, name variants,
  lookalike-consumable guard, typed-error, lossless end-to-end), `internal/discord/
  attack_handler_outofammo_test.go` (dm-queue routing + degraded paths). `go build ./...`,
  `go vet`, combat + discord + cmd wiring suites green.
- **Live caveat:** the running stack must be **rebuilt (`make build`) and restarted** for
  the fix to apply. Existing characters need no data change — the matcher now reads their
  current inventory correctly.
- **Follow-up FIXED (2026-06-26, separate commit):** builder ammo seeding corrected.
  `EquipmentToInventoryWithEquipped` now parses a `:N` quantity suffix (and comma-batched
  options), classifies SRD ammo IDs (`crossbow-bolt`, `arrow`, …) as `type:"ammunition"`,
  and gives them a proper display name (`"Crossbow Bolts"`). The Svelte builder no longer
  strips `:20` on submit (new `lib/equipment-assembly.js` `assembleEquipment` —
  bare-id list still feeds the equipped pickers; a quantity-preserving list goes to the
  backend). So a new crossbow user starts with **20 bolts**, typed ammunition, not one
  `gear` slug. Go + vitest TDD; bundle rebuilt.
- **Still open:** the same narrow-projection field-drop exists on the spell
  material-component path (`spellcasting.go`) — unrelated to ammo, left as-is.

### ISSUE-017 — Permanent SSOT item catalog (kills the slug/type/quantity drift class) — SCOPED for a fresh agent
- **Date:** 2026-06-26
- **Area:** refdata / item catalog (cross-cutting: refdata, portal builder, combat, dashboard JS)
- **Severity:** major (tech-debt; each occurrence has been a player-facing bug)
- **Status:** OPEN — SCOPED (no code yet). This entry is the spec; implement in phases.
- **Why this exists:** three+ separate live-play bugs share ONE root cause — item/equipment
  metadata is fragmented with no single source of truth, so any new item id (or a slug
  rename) silently drifts between layers:
  - **ISSUE-013** — background→skill/equipment slug drift between two hand-maintained Go maps.
  - **ISSUE-015 (ammo)** — combat matcher expected name `"Bolts"`/type `"ammunition"`; the
    builder seeded `{item_id:"crossbow-bolt", type:"gear"}`. Patched with a tolerant matcher.
  - **builder-ammo follow-up** — ammo had no name/type/quantity anywhere; patched with a local
    `knownAmmo` map + `:N` parsing. **Explicitly a stopgap.**
- **The 5 fragmented sources today (grep-verified 2026-06-26):**
  1. `internal/refdata` seeders (`seeder.go`) — **weapons + armor only**. Ammo
     (`crossbow-bolt`, `arrow`, `sling-bullet`, `blowgun-needle`) and adventuring gear
     (packs, tools, torches…) have **no refdata row at all** — they exist only as bare ids
     inside `internal/portal/starting_equipment.go` strings.
  2. `internal/portal/builder_store_adapter.go` — hand-maintained `knownWeapons`,
     `knownArmor`, `knownAmmo` Go maps + `itemDisplayName` + `itemType` + `parseEquipmentEntry`.
  3. `portal/svelte/src/lib/equip-selection.js` — a PARALLEL JS SRD-id fallback set
     (`knownWeapons`/`knownArmor` mirrors) used so pickers work before the async catalog loads.
  4. `internal/combat/attack.go` — `GetAmmunitionName` hardcodes crossbow→`"Bolts"` by
     substring; `ammoMatches` matches by name/`item_id` keyword because **no weapon→ammo-item
     link exists in data**.
  5. `internal/portal/refdata_adapter.go` `ListEquipment` (serves `/api/equipment`) — builds
     its catalog from `ListWeapons`+`ListArmor` only, so ammo/gear never appear in the API.
- **Target design — one canonical seeded item catalog:**
  - A new refdata table (e.g. `items`) or an extension that gives **every** equipment id a row:
    `id, name, category ("weapon"|"armor"|"ammunition"|"gear"|"tool"|"pack"|…), default_quantity,
    stackable bool`, plus category-specific metadata. Weapons/armor can stay in their existing
    tables if the catalog references them, but ammo + gear MUST get rows.
  - A **weapon→ammo link**: add `ammunition_id` (FK to the ammo item) to weapons with the
    `ammunition` property (light/hand/heavy-crossbow → `crossbow-bolt`; shortbow/longbow →
    `arrow`; sling → `sling-bullet`; blowgun → `blowgun-needle`). This replaces the
    `GetAmmunitionName` substring heuristic AND lets the matcher match by **item id**, not a
    name keyword (removes the `"Lightning Bolt Scroll"` false-positive risk entirely).
- **Phased implementation (TDD each phase; keep each independently shippable):**
  1. **Catalog schema + seed.** New migration + refdata seeder rows for SRD ammo + the
     adventuring gear / packs / tools referenced by `starting_equipment.go` and
     `backgrounds_gen.go`. sqlc queries (`ListItems`, `GetItem`). **Migration test hooks:** a
     new migration breaks `internal/testutil/testdb.go` table lists + the database `MigrateDown`
     test unless BOTH are updated (see the `project_new_migration_test_hooks` memory).
  2. **Weapon→ammo FK.** Add `ammunition_id` to the weapon rows; expose via the weapon model.
     Rewrite `combat.GetAmmunitionName` to read the FK (fallback to current heuristic if null),
     and switch `ammoMatches` to prefer item-id equality against the weapon's `ammunition_id`,
     keeping the keyword match only as a legacy fallback. Existing combat ammo tests must stay
     green.
  3. **Builder seeds via catalog.** `EquipmentToInventoryWithEquipped` resolves name / type /
     default_quantity from the catalog instead of `knownWeapons`/`knownArmor`/`knownAmmo` /
     `itemDisplayName`. Keep `:N` override (explicit quantity wins over default). Retire the
     three local Go maps once the catalog covers their ids; add a **contract test** that every
     id in `starting_equipment.go` + `backgrounds_gen.go` resolves to a catalog row (mirrors
     ISSUE-013's `TestBackground*_AllBuilderBackgrounds`, so future drift fails CI).
  4. **API + frontend SSOT.** `ListEquipment` serves the full catalog (ammo + gear, with
     `category` + `default_quantity`). Retire the JS SRD-fallback maps in `equip-selection.js`
     by **generating** the JS catalog/classifier from the Go source — follow the existing
     codegen precedent (`portal/svelte/src/lib/backgrounds.json` ← `backgrounds_gen.go` /
     `generate.go`). One source, both languages, no hand-sync.
  5. **Cleanup.** Delete the now-dead stopgaps (`knownAmmo`, duplicated maps); update the
     `project_item_catalog_ssot_gap` memory to RESOLVED.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - A brand-new portal-built crossbow user has `{item_id:"crossbow-bolt", name:"Crossbow Bolts",
    type:"ammunition", quantity:20}` sourced from the catalog (no local map).
  - `combat.GetAmmunitionName`/`ammoMatches` resolve a weapon's ammo via the FK; the substring
    heuristic is gone from the hot path.
  - `/api/equipment` lists ammo + gear; `equip-selection.js` no longer hand-maintains SRD ids.
  - A contract test fails CI if any starting-equipment / background id lacks a catalog row.
  - `make cover-check` (90%/85%), full vitest, `make sqlc-check`, and a Svelte rebuild all green.
- **Effort:** ~M–L (new migration + seeder + sqlc + rewiring 4 call sites + codegen + contract
  tests). Phases 1–3 deliver the bulk of the value (correct seeding + combat); 4–5 remove the
  remaining duplication. Each phase is independently shippable.
- **Pointers:** codegen precedent `internal/portal/backgrounds_gen.go` + `generate.go`; current
  stopgaps `internal/portal/builder_store_adapter.go` (`knownAmmo`/`itemType`/`itemDisplayName`),
  `internal/combat/attack.go` (`GetAmmunitionName`/`ammoMatches`); catalog source
  `internal/portal/refdata_adapter.go` `ListEquipment`. Memory: `project_item_catalog_ssot_gap`.
