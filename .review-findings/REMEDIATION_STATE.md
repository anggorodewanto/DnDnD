## In Progress
- (none)

## Done (closed + reviewer passed)
- [x] F-1: WS URL mismatch — closed 2026-05-12 — review: PASS — commit `a5ed9de`
- [x] F-2: DM-role enforcement on dashboard routes — closed 2026-05-12 — review: PASS — commit `b23a8cd`. Worker flagged follow-up: per-resource authz on `/api/maps/import`, `/api/combat/*`, `/api/levelup`, party-rest, loot/item-picker/shops (separate scope).
- [x] F-3: `conditions_ref` SQL table — closed 2026-05-12 (NO-CODE-CHANGE; already implemented in Phase 3 — `4a1c5d3`). Verified: table created in `db/migrations/20260310120002_create_reference_tables.sql:31-38` with spec columns (id PK, name, description, mechanical_effects JSONB); sqlc queries `GetCondition`, `ListConditions`, `CountConditions`, `UpsertCondition` in `db/queries/conditions.sql`; 16-row seed (14 SRD + exhaustion + surprised) in `internal/refdata/seeder.go:180-355` via `UpsertCondition ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` (idempotent); integration tests `TestIntegration_ReferenceTablesMigration`, `TestIntegration_SeedAll_ListConditions`, `TestConditionCount_IncludesSurprised` all PASS. Finding text in `FINAL_REVIEW.md §Medium #3` and `.review-findings/05-cross-cutting.md` was stale at audit time. Mechanical-effects JSONB format: `[{effect_type, target?, condition?, value?, description?}]` — descriptive vocabulary (Feature Effect System terms); Go code in `internal/combat/condition_effects.go` remains the source of truth for enforcement per Design Decision #2.

## Skipped (with justification)
- [~] DEFER-1: Phase 121.4 transcripts — documented deferral until live playtest (FINAL_REVIEW.md §Acknowledged)
- [~] DEFER-2: Phase 84 combat-time `/use`/`/give` costs — explicitly deferred at phases.md:485
